More than just a co-working space, Vidacity embodies the very principles its tenants champion: reuse what already exists instead of building from scratch. The campus retains its school character, with classrooms turned into startup offices and corridors lined with sustainability exhibits, creating an environment where purpose-driven ventures feel at home.",
          "For BugBoom, Vidacity provides affordable workspace at under $500 per month, a critical lifeline for a student-led venture operating at a loss. But the value extends far beyond cheap rent. The co-location of multiple sustainability startups creates a micro-community where founders share knowledge, resources, and emotional support over coffee conversations, an unspoken support system that several of our group members observed during the visit."

Vidacity buys them time to iterate on their BSF technology, refine their business model, and build community trust without compromising their environmental mission for short-term revenue. As Finding 06 notes, for startups like BugBoom, finding a supportive 'habitat' is as important as the idea itself."

          "Singapore generated 784,000 tonnes of food waste in 2024, with only 18% recycled. Food waste makes up about 12% of total waste generated nationally. The founders recognised that this isn't just an environmental statistic; it represents a massive nutrient stream being sent to incineration instead of being recirculated. Their motivation is rooted in a genuine belief that waste is a misplaced resource, not something to throw away. As the founders put it: 'We're not just managing waste; we're keeping nutrients in the loop, where they belong.'"

The knowledge they needed (biology, regulations, economics, community management) was never taught in a single course. It was assembled through persistent trial and error, conversations with mentors, and the willingness to learn outside their academic disciplines. This 'learning by doing' approach is what separates ventures that survive from those that dissolve after the hackathon."

          "Find your ecosystem early: A supportive habitat like Vidacity, with affordable space, mentorship, and community, dramatically increases survival odds. Purpose-driven startups cannot afford to burn capital on overhead when their path to profitability is long.",
          "Start selling before you're ready: BugBoom's early market testing, even at a loss (~$7/pack for frass), generated invaluable customer feedback and validated demand. Waiting for a 'perfect' product means missing real-world learning.",
          "Build a team with complementary skills, not just shared passion: Each BugBoom founder owns a distinct domain (operations, international expansion, R&D, outreach). Shared purpose holds the team together, but complementary expertise is what moves the venture forward.",
          "Treat hackathon wins as seed funding, not validation: The KSIP prize was the beginning, not the destination. Most teams dissolve after winning. The structured two-tranche payout model forced BugBoom to prove ongoing accountability. Aspiring founders should seek similar accountability mechanisms.",
          "Embrace the unglamorous work: Sorting food waste, managing larvae, sieving frass, this is the daily reality behind every sustainability pitch deck. If you're not willing to do the 'unsexy' work, the venture won't survive past the idea stage."

          "Regulatory barriers are real: Technical feasibility does not equal market feasibility. BugBoom's international expansion plans face strict import/export regulations for insect-based products, and founders must research regulatory landscapes early.",
          "Co-founder alignment matters: When asked about their selling price, BugBoom's founders gave answers ranging from $350k to 'never sell.' While diverse perspectives can be healthy, founders should discuss exit expectations and long-term alignment early in their journey.",
          "Education is a product, not just a cost: BugBoom's workshops create a secondary revenue stream while building the public trust necessary for their core business. Founders should consider how 'teaching what you do' can become part of the business model.",
          "Financial resilience takes creativity: With the startup operating at a loss and founders balancing academics and other work, financial sustainability requires creative approaches such as tranche-based funding, diversified revenue streams (products + services + education), and lean operations."
